# Reproducible (and Accessible) Research
## Research as Software?

# Introduction

- This talk will give a lightening overview of the tools currently available to facilitate reproducible research - focusing on the tools available for R users.

- It will explore why reproducible research is increasingly important as science becomes increasing dependent on code.
---

# Traditional Research

1. Develop idea

1. Get data

1. Analysis

1. iteratively get more data and improve analysis

1. Write up results as a peer reviewed publication

1. Submit to Journals

1. Respond to reviewer comments

1. Publish

---

# Example: 

- Aim 
- Method
- Results
- Applications

---

# Issues

- Data
- Method
- Full results

---

# Research as Software: General Tools

Software developers have developed many practices and technologies to make their work usable by others. Some examples include;

- Standalone software

- Git, GitHub, GitLab etc.

- Unit testing

- Continuous integration, i.e [travis.org](https://travis-ci.org/),[https://circleci.com/](https://circleci.com/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/), etc.

- Make

- Docker

# Research as Software: R specific Tools

R's package based ecosystem has led to the development of many tools, both explicitly for research, and also for tools for package development etc. which can be re-purposed. Some examples of these are;

- Rstudio projects

- here

- Rmarkdown (alternatively [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks), with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)

- R packages, which allows the use of the following;

  - usethis and devtools
  
  - pkgdown
  
  - testthat
  
  - roxygen2
  
- drake
- pomp

# Example: NBA Free Throw Data Analysis

- Data on NBA free throws

- Exploratory analysis on the data (as part of a job interview)

- Produce documentation for the analysis

- Wrapped in an R package ([MangoTest](https://github.com/seabbs/MangoTest))

---

# Raw data

---

# R code

---

# Documentation

---

# Tests

---

# Analysis

---

# Makefiles


---


# Dockerfile


---

# Problems with this approach

- Large raw data (or confidential data)

- Large results files

---

# Solutions - Raw Data


- Store raw data externally, bind for processing, and then store the processed data (which is hopefully small enough to be contained in the repository)

- External docker container

- External database

- External package to process raw data, including data instructions. i.e [tbinenglanddataclean](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/tbinenglanddataclean).

- External package to interface with the data and provide functionality to enable rapid exploration, i.e [getTBinR](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/getTBinR/)

---

# Solutions - Results

- As for raw data

- Optionally summarise to a form which can be stored

- If results cannot be summarised to a point at which they can be easily made public consider providing an interactive interface to the data. This could use [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), an example of this approach can be seen [here](http://www.seabbs.co.uk/shiny/fcdashboard/).

## More needs to be done here!

# Wrap up

This talk has given a lightening quick tour of some of the software tools available which may be used to facilitate reproducible research - focusing on those available for R users.

---

# Key Messages

- The published paper should only be the advert for the research. The repository containing the code, documentation, tests etc. should be considered as the research.

- Considering how you would reproduce your work on another computer is a good start!

- Practices and tools can be borrowed from software developers

- All of these techniques are already widely used by data scientists in Businesses. This means that there are lots of resources for learning more.
