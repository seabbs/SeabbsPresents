# Who am I?

* **Postdoctoral researcher:** Infectious disease dynamics.<sup>1</sup>

* **PhD:** Modelling tuberculosis and the optimal usage of the BCG vaccination.<sup>2</sup>

* **Previously:** Mathematics, theoretical physics, applied mathematics, and data science in finance.

* **Sideline:** Open source software, reproducibilty + hounding people on the internet about reproducibility.

* **Currently:** Modelling zoonotic tuberculosis burden + job hunting.

# Alternatives?

---

# Word

## Pros

* Everyone likely knows how to use it
* Some automation maybe possible using plug-ins? 

## Cons

* Can be hard to format documents well.
* May be difficult to update.
* Likely to break at random.
* Customisation.
* Automation.
* Closed source.
* It isn't very cool.

**I think we all know the answer is no... **

---

# LaTex

## Pros

* Creates beautiful documents.
* Extensively customisable.
* Open source.
* Automation available via scripting.

## Cons

* Relatively high barrier to entry (for me).
* Hard to read in its raw form (for me).
* Updating may be tedious (for me).
* Maintaining a LaTex install can be annoying (for me) - time to use `tinytex`.
* Only a little cool - we didn't all do maths/science degrees.

# Automating Latex

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/latex-automation.png")
```

# Options in R

---

# Overview

### [`{Rmarkdown}`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

Write R code and text -> document $+$ a customised `.tex` or `.css` template.

### [`{vitea}`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/) + [`{Rmarkdown}`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

LaTeX templates, with helpful functions to add content to the documents 

### [`{pagedown}`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) + [`{Rmarkdown}`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

Paginate the HTML Output of R Markdown with CSS for Print. No need to install LaTeX to get beautiful PDFs.

# Added benefits

---

# Benefits

* Easy to read as near plain text.

* All the power of Latex or CSS with a much lower barrier to entry.

* Easy to update - updates can be to text files (i.e. .`csv`'s) that are then pulled into R.

* Access to all other R tooling.

* Automation.

* People will think you are cool (well I will).
---

# Automation

### [`{tinytex}`](https://github.com/yihui/tinytex)

### [`{scholar}`](https://github.com/jkeirstead/scholar)

### [`{tic}`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic.website)

### [`{rorchid}`](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid)

### Other

* Logic to generated different CV types for different jobs

* Pull in GitHub projects and commit histories

* Sync with LinkedIn?

#Summary

---

# Summary

* Other options exist but for useRs R offers a nice balance of ease of use and customisation. 

* Essentially combing `{Rmarkdown}` with a template package. 

* Once implemented in R any other package can be used with ease. 

* This allows: automated updates, data read from plain text, paper syncing from google scholar, 
profile scyncing from Orchid, project updates from GitHub, and many many other things!!

* See the links for more info and feel free to contact me with any questions.
