# What do I do?

---

# Overview

* Postdoctoral researcher (as of September `r emo::ji('fireworks')`) in infectious disease modelling.

* Focussing on policy relevent modelling of Tuberculosis and BCG vaccination.

* Looking to move into related infectious disease research areas.

* Aim is to make research about the code and not the paper.

# What would I do with the fellowship?

---

# Raising the profile of software > code > papers


* Infectious disease modelling community has varying levels of reproducibility and code quality and software development.

* Code is often not shared. 

* Even if researchers have the best intentions code can be difficult to use.

* There maybe little documentation, no testing, and no long term support.

* Keen to form a a community of best practice for infectious disease modellers. Most often it is not about not wanting to produce reusable code but about not knowing how. 

* Often there is little acknowledgement of efforts to be reproducible (reviewers frequently do not look at code). Recognition from the SSI would be a great way of acknowledging the value of this input. 

---

# Running a hackathon for infectious disesase modelling tool development

* Soon to be attending a health economics hackathon that aims to the community about software best practices and also develop tools with the imput of domain experts. 

* Would like to replicate this for infectious disease modelling.

* Key aim would be to build out the community around `{idmodelr}` but any other tooling would be treated on a equal footing. 

---

# Expanding my horizons. 

* I feel fairly well versed in what constitutes good R software. 

* I know very little about wider best practices or best practices in other languages.

* I would aim to use this fellowship as a chance to connect with a broader community and feedback my findings to infectious disease modellers using R.

#  Summary

---

# Who am I?
 
 * Postdoctoral researcher in infectious disease modelling.
 
 * Background in modelling, data science and mathematics
 
 * Passionate about moving from papers, to code, and ultimately to software. 

---

# What do I do?

* Researching how to improve interventions against infectious disease.

* Focus on reproducibility and tool making.

* Author of multiple CRAN packages.

* Reviewer at JOSS. 

* Active blogger/tweeter/presenter on #rstats, open science and infectious diseases.

* Co-organiser of BristolR

---

## What would I do with the fellowship?

* Raising the profile of software > code > papers in the infectious disease modelling community.

* Running a hackathon to engage infectious disease modellers with open source tool development (`{idmodelr}` and beyond).

* Broadening my knowledge of the open source community beyond #rstats (SSI collab workshop etc.).
