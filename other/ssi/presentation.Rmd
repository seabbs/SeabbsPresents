# PhD Focus: Tuberculosis

* Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the oldest human diseases, with recorded cases in ancient Egypt, renaissance Europe, and in the modern day across the globe.

* It is thought to infect over 1.7 billion people globally, of which 5-15% will develop symptomatic TB in their lifetime (World Health Organisation 2018).

* Of this number around 10% are likely to die from TB or TB related causes and globally TB remains the leading cause of death from infectious disease. 

* TB is preventable and curable, but the majority of cases occur in less economically developed countries and are never diagnosed.

#  Summary (1 minute)

---

# Who am I?
 
 * Postdoctoral researcher in infectious disease modelling.
 
 * Background in epidemiology, mathematics, applied mathematics and theoretical physics.
 
 * Previously data scientist
 
 * Passionate about open science + open source software. 

---

# What do I do?

* Researching how to improve interventions against infectious disease.

* Focus on reproducibility and tool making.

* Author of two CRAN packages + several others still on GitHub.

* Reviewer at JOSS. 

* Active blogger/tweeter on #rstats, open science and infectious diseases.

---

## What would I do with the fellowship?

* Raising the profile of my open source work and promoting it (and open source software more generally) in the infectious disease modelling community.

* Running a hackathon to engage infectious disease modellers with open source tool development (`{idmodelr}` and beyond).

* Broadening my knowledge of the open source community beyond #rstats (SSI collab workshop etc.).
