# Interests

* Infectious disease dynamics.

* Improving infectious disease modelling practice and the scientific workflow more generally.

* Informing policy and enabling others to do so in a more robust manner. 

* Engaging the wider community with science and actively involving them where possible.

# Data analysis


#### Evidence for associations between BCG vaccination and TB outcomes.<sup>1</sup>

* Some evidence in the literature for non-specific effects of the BCG vaccine.
    
* Selected several that are most commonly reported and then used logistic regression to explore the evidence for associations.
    
#### Missing data in the Enhanced Surviellance (ETS) system<sup>2</sup>

* Structure of missing data.
    
* Logistic regression used to explore the relationships between demographic variables and missing data for key outcomes.

# Statistical modelling

#### Estimating the impact of the 2005 change in BCG vaccination policy<sup>1</sup>

* Regression analysis looking at TB incidence rates pre and post the change in BCG policy in the targeted populations.

* Developed multiple model structures and confounders using expert knowledge. 

* Ranked models based on fit the the available data (WAIC and LOO).

#### Modelling zoonotic tuberculosis burden (*in progress*)

 * Data sourced from multiple sources, cleaned, combined, and mapped
    
 * Modelled using GAMs in a bayesian framework so that error in outcome and error in variables can be accounted for. 
 
 * Presented as an R package to be reused as data improves.

# Dynamic modelling

#### Developed a model of BCG vaccination and TB transmission in the UK.

* Semi-stochastic dynamic transmission model with a high -> low risk latency structure.

* Age-stratified with realistic demographics.

* Externally forced based on non-UK born incidence.


#### Model fitting

* Model fitting pipeline developed in R including SMC-SMC (using `LibBi` and `rbi`) model comparison (AIC), parameter sensitivity (PRCC), and scenario comparison (mixing structure).

* Final model fit (at PhD hand in) was extremely poor even with post-hoc calibration.

* Conclusion: Model overly complex for approach and needed simplification.

# Other


#### Dynamic model of BCG vaccination and TB transmission globally

* Aim: What is the incidence rate thresold at which an effective TB vaccine should be given to adults rather than neonates (assuming limited duration).

* Model implemented using `pomp`.

* Project dropped in favour of previous modelling project.

#### Contributing to improving cost effectiveness tooling<sup>1</sup>

 * BCEA package review and overhaul.
    
* Profiling Markov modelling code + speeding up using a functional approach and C code.
