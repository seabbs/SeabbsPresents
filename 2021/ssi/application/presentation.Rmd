# Background

* Postdoctoral researcher in infectious disease dynamics.<sup>1</sup>

* PhD: Modelling tuberculosis and the optimal usage of the BCG vaccination.<sup>2</sup>

* Previously: Mathematics, theoretical physics, applied mathematics, and data science in finance. 

* Currently: Modelling zoonotic tuberculosis burden and actively looking for new research ideas/funding.

# Interests

* Infectious disease dynamics.

* Improving infectious disease modelling practice and scientific workflow more generally.

* Informing policy and enabling others to do so in a more robust manner. 

* Engaging the wider community with science and actively involving them where possible.

* Next section for more.

# What would I do with the fellowship?

---

# Raising the profile of software > code > papers


* Infectious disease modelling community has varying levels of reproducibility, code quality and software development.

* Code is often not shared at all. 

* Even if researchers have the best intentions code can be difficult to use.

* There maybe little documentation, no testing, and no long term support.

* Keen to form a community of best practice for infectious disease modellers. Most often it is not about not wanting to produce reusable code but about not knowing how. 

* Often there is little acknowledgement of efforts to be reproducible and develop software (reviewers frequently do not look at code). Recognition from the SSI would be a great way of acknowledging the value of this input. 

---

# Running a hackathon for infectious disesase modelling tool development

* Soon to be attending a health economics hackathon that aims to teach the community about software best practices and also develop tools with the input of domain experts. 

* Would like to replicate this for infectious disease modelling.

* Key aim would be to build out the community around `{idmodelr}` but any other tooling would be treated on a equal footing. 

---

# Expanding my horizons. 

* I feel well versed in what constitutes good R software. 

* I know very little about wider best practices or best practices in other languages.

* Aim is to use this fellowship as a chance to connect with a broader community and feedback my findings to infectious disease modellers using R and the wider R community.
